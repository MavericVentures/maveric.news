# Scheduler Options Matrix

This document compares different scheduling options for automating the content pipeline.

## Comparison Matrix

| Criteria | Buffer API | Node Cron + API Calls | Zapier/Make |
|----------|------------|----------------------|-------------|
| **Cost** | $15-$100/month depending on plan | Free (self-hosted) + server costs | Free tier available, $20-$50/month for automation needs |
| **Implementation Effort** | Low (uses existing API) | Medium (requires custom code) | Low (no-code solution) |
| **API Limits** | 2,000 posts/day (Business plan) | Depends on target platforms | 1,000-100,000 operations/month depending on plan |
| **Sandbox Environment** | Yes | Yes (can be set up locally) | Limited testing options |
| **Reliability** | High (managed service) | Medium (depends on server uptime) | High (managed service) |
| **Flexibility** | Medium (limited to Buffer features) | High (fully customizable) | Medium-High (many integrations) |
| **Maintenance** | Low (managed by Buffer) | High (self-maintained) | Low (managed service) |

## Detailed Analysis

### Buffer API
- **Pros**: Easy integration, reliable service, built for social media posting
- **Cons**: Monthly cost, limited customization, dependent on third-party

### Node Cron + API Calls
- **Pros**: Full control, customizable, one-time setup cost
- **Cons**: Requires server maintenance, potential reliability issues, more complex implementation

### Zapier/Make
- **Pros**: Easy to set up, visual workflow builder, many integrations
- **Cons**: Can get expensive with scale, limited complex logic capabilities

## Recommendation for v1

**Recommended Solution: Node Cron + API Calls**

Rationale:
1. **Cost-effective** for early-stage implementation
2. **Maximum flexibility** to adapt to changing requirements
3. **Full control** over the entire pipeline
4. **No dependency** on third-party scheduling logic
5. **Easier integration** with our existing scripts (idea_miner.py and post_generator_v0.py)

Implementation Plan:
1. Set up a simple Node.js server with cron jobs
2. Schedule the Idea Miner to run daily
3. Schedule the Post Generator to run after the Idea Miner
4. Implement direct API posting to social media platforms
5. Add monitoring and error handling

This approach allows us to maintain full control over the content pipeline while minimizing ongoing costs. As the project scales, we can reevaluate and potentially migrate to a managed service like Buffer or Zapier/Make if the maintenance overhead becomes significant.
